# Design log

## 2026-10-05: M0 setup

- **Repo root is this folder**, not a nested `lightning-acoustics/`. The package is `thunder` under `src/` and installs with `pip install -e .`.
- **`MicArray` instead of `Array`.** The spec calls the contract `Array`, but that name is easily confused with numpy arrays.
- **`Atmosphere` is an abstract base class**, not a dataclass. It defines profile methods (`temperature`, `wind`, `relative_humidity`, `sound_speed`) and `propagate(sources, receivers) -> ArrivalPath`. `UniformAtmosphere` is the straight-line, constant-c implementation that Phase 2 will use. Phase 3 adds ray-table implementations behind the same interface.
- **Ground truth sits in `Recording.truth`** (`GroundTruth`). An AST-based test fails if anything under `recon/` imports `GroundTruth` or reads `.truth`.
- **Configs reject unknown keys** (`extra="forbid"`), so typos fail loudly. Each phase adds its own config section when it is built; M0 only has top-level run settings.
- **Run folder name** is `<UTC timestamp>_<config hash>_s<seed>`. The config hash is SHA-256 over the canonical JSON of the resolved config.
- **Constants:** Hill's 16° and Few's 0.63 are marked `# VERIFY`. `SOUND_SPEED_COEFF` is derived from gamma, R and M (about 20.047), not hard-coded as 20.05.
